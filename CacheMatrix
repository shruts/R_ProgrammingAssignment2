## The following functions calculate the inverse of a matrix and saves it
## to the cache such that the next time the user attempts to calculate the
## matrix inverse, the previously saved value is returned instead of
## repeating the calculation.

## This function creates a special "matrix" object, which is really a list 
## containing a function to
## 1. set the value of the matrix
## 2. get the value of the matrix
## 3. set the value of the inverse
## 4. get the value of the inverse


makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) { 

  if(det(x)!= 0) ## Inverse Matrixs are possible if only Determinent 
                 # of matrix is not equel to 0 
      {
    catchsolve<- solve(x)  # catching the  inverse matrix
    print(catchsolve)      # printing it  
  }
  else { P<-"No invers of this matrix as determinent =0"
        print(P)
   }
  }
